* Rules
  1. The following rules are to be considered "...of thumb." They can, and likely will, be broken. That does not mean they shouldn't be strived for.
  2. Dual rail
  3. Adjustable Current: 0 -> 5A
  4. Adjustable Voltage: 3 -> 24VDC
  5. Runs off line voltage
  6. Transforming and Rectification to be designed.
     1. But willing to flex in actual hardware. Line Voltage is still terrifying as all get out
  7.
